  abstract  = {Many real-world search and optimization problems involve
               inequality and/or equality constraints and are thus posed as
               constrained optimization problems. In trying to solve constrained
               optimization problems using genetic algorithms (GAs) or classical
               optimization methods, penalty function methods have been the most
               popular approach, because of their simplicity and ease of
               implementation. However, since the penalty function approach is
               generic and applicable to any type of constraint (linear or
               nonlinear), their performance is not always satisfactory. Thus,
               researchers have developed sophisticated penalty functions
               specific to the problem at hand and the search algorithm used for
               optimization. However, the most difficult aspect of the penalty
               function approach is to find appropriate penalty parameters
               needed to guide the search towards the constrained optimum. In
               this paper, GA's population-based approach and ability to make
               pair-wise comparison in tournament selection operator are
               exploited to devise a penalty function approach that does not
               require any penalty parameter. Careful comparisons among feasible
               and infeasible solutions are made so as to provide a search
               direction towards the feasible region. Once sufficient feasible
               solutions are found, a niching method (along with a controlled
               mutation operator) is used to maintain diversity among feasible
               solutions. This allows a real-parameter GA's crossover operator
               to continuously find better feasible solutions, gradually leading
               the search near the true optimum solution. GAs with this
               constraint handling approach have been tested on nine problems
               commonly used in the literature, including an engineering design
               problem. In all cases, the proposed approach has been able to
               repeatedly find solutions closer to the true optimum solution
               than that reported earlier.},

  abstract  = {A comprehensive introduction to optimization with a focus on
               practical algorithms for the design of engineering systems.This
               book offers a comprehensive introduction to optimization with a
               focus on practical algorithms. The book approaches optimization
               from an engineering perspective, where the objective is to design
               a system that optimizes a set of metrics subject to constraints.
               Readers will learn about computational approaches for a range of
               challenges, including searching high-dimensional spaces, handling
               problems where there are multiple competing objectives, and
               accommodating uncertainty in the metrics. Figures, examples, and
               exercises convey the intuition behind the mathematical
               approaches. The text provides concrete implementations in the
               Julia programming language. Topics covered include derivatives
               and their generalization to multiple dimensions; local descent
               and first- and second-order methods that inform local descent;
               stochastic methods, which introduce randomness into the
               optimization process; linear constrained optimization, when both
               the objective function and the constraints are linear; surrogate
               models, probabilistic surrogate models, and using probabilistic
               surrogate models to guide optimization; optimization under
               uncertainty; uncertainty propagation; expression optimization;
               and multidisciplinary design optimization. Appendixes offer an
               introduction to the Julia language, test functions for evaluating
               algorithm performance, and mathematical concepts used in the
               derivation and analysis of the optimization methods discussed in
               the text. The book can be used by advanced undergraduates and
               graduate students in mathematics, statistics, computer science,
               any engineering field, (including electrical engineering and
               aerospace engineering), and operations research, and as a
               reference for professionals.},

  abstract = {© 2017 ACM. There is an increasing interest in learning outside of the traditional classroom setting. This is especially true for topics covering computational tools and data science, as both are challenging to incorporate in the standard curriculum. These atypical learning environments offer new opportunities for teaching, particularly when it comes to combining conceptual knowledge with hands-on experience/expertise with methods and skills. Advances in cloud computing and containerized environments provide an attractive opportunity to improve the effciency and ease with which students can learn. This manuscript details recent advances towards using commonly-Available cloud computing services and advanced cyberinfrastructure support for improving the learning experience in bootcamp-style events. We cover the benets (and challenges) of using a server hosted remotely instead of relying on student laptops, discuss the technology that was used in order to make this possible, and give suggestions for how others could implement and improve upon this model for pedagogy and reproducibility.},

  abstract = {© 2017 Holdgraf, Rieger, Micheli, Martin, Knight and Theunissen. Cognitive neuroscience has seen rapid growth in the size and complexity of data recorded from the human brain as well as in the computational tools available to analyze this data. This data explosion has resulted in an increased use of multivariate, model-based methods for asking neuroscience questions, allowing scientists to investigate multiple hypotheses with a single dataset, to use complex, time-varying stimuli, and to study the human brain under more naturalistic conditions. These tools come in the form of “Encoding” models, in which stimulus features are used to model brain activity, and “Decoding” models, in which neural features are used to generated a stimulus output. Here we review the current state of encoding and decoding models in cognitive electrophysiology and provide a practical guide toward conducting experiments and analyses in this emerging field. Our examples focus on using linear models in the study of human language and audition. We show how to calculate auditory receptive fields from natural sounds as well as how to decode neural recordings to predict speech. The paper aims to be a useful tutorial to these approaches, and a practical introduction to using machine learning and applied statistics to build models of neural activity. The data analytic approaches we discuss may also be applied to other sensory modalities, motor systems, and cognitive systems, and we cover some examples in these areas. In addition, a collection of Jupyter notebooks is publicly available as a complement to the material covered in this paper, providing code examples and tutorials for predictive modeling in python. The aimis to provide a practical understanding of predictivemodeling of human brain data and to propose best-practices in conducting these analyses.},
